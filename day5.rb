# object lifecycle
# create vs new - save
# callbacks related to object lifecycle
# when to use and not to use callbacks - purpose
# hooks - callback relation
# no for business logic, mailer(send mails even in testing or something inside console) and similar scenarios use in callbacks
#forms - html vs rails 
# strong parameters
# business logic and others in models/services
# migrations - db
# up down - irreversible
# scaffold vs generate
# directly feeding inside pre built migrate file - issue
# if down/solo developer/development - can edit, if up/production - cannnot edit create new
# new migration rather edit pre built
# rollback - only when not shared among other devs
# hack rollback - can use version id rollback any - step / version
# deleting migrate file before rollback issue - schema migration table but changes still exist in our table after these steps
