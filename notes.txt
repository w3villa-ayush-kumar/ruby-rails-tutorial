Topic: Ruby Version Managers

👉 What it is:
Tools like RVM manage multiple Ruby versions on one machine.

👉 Why it matters in Rails:
Every Rails project depends on a specific Ruby version.

Mismatch = broken gems, crashes, weird bugs.

👉 Golden Rule:
Always match the Ruby version of the project you are working on.

👉 Senior Tip:
Use .ruby-version in every project.


Topic: Ruby Version Alignment

👉 What it is: Using the same Ruby version locally as the production/project app.

👉 Why it matters in Rails:
Rails apps are tightly coupled with gem versions. Even minor Ruby differences can break bundler, native gems, or Rails boot.

👉 Golden Rule:
Match the project Ruby. Always.

👉 Senior Tip:
Use .ruby-version so RVM auto-switches per folder.


Topic: Blocks

👉 What it is: A block is a chunk of code passed to a method.

👉 Why it matters in Rails: Rails DSL heavily relies on blocks.

Example:

3.times do |i|
  puts i
end

👉 Mental Model: Think of it like a callback function in JavaScript — but cleaner.

JS:

[1,2,3].forEach(n => console.log(n))

Ruby:

[1,2,3].each { |n| puts n }

👉 Gotcha: Do NOT confuse blocks with methods — they are not objects unless converted to Procs.
